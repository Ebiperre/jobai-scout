## JobAI Scout

## Overview

JobAI Scout is a web application that leverages AI and machine learning to aggregate job listings from platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, RemoteOK, Glassdoor, and Jobberman. It provides personalized job recommendations, predicts salary ranges for listings without them, generates tailored cover letters, analyzes uploaded CVs for job fit, and offers job-specific tips. The app aims to streamline the job search process with a user-friendly interface and intelligent features.

## Features

Job Aggregation: Fetches jobs from multiple platforms using APIs (or ethical scraping where APIs are unavailable).
Salary Prediction: Uses ML models to estimate salaries for job listings lacking this info, based on role, location, and industry data.
Cover Letter Generation: AI-driven cover letters customized to job descriptions and user profiles.
CV Analysis: Upload CVs to extract skills/experience and get suggestions for tailoring to specific roles.
Job Tips: Provides AI-generated advice for interviews and applications.
Personalized Search: Matches jobs to user preferences and CV content using NLP and embeddings.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (or Next.js) for a dynamic, responsive UI.
Backend: Python with FastAPI for handling API requests and ML integration.
Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase free tier) for storing user data and job listings.
ML/AI: scikit-learn for salary prediction, spaCy for CV parsing, HuggingFace for embeddings/cover letter generation.
Storage/Auth: Firebase for file uploads and user authentication.
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend), free tiers initially.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the Repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobai-scout.git
cd jobai-scout


## Frontend Setup:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start


## Backend Setup:

Install Python 3.8+.
Set up a virtual environment:cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn spacy


Run the server:uvicorn server:app --reload




## Database:

Sign up for Supabase, create a PostgreSQL instance, and note the connection string.
Add to environment variables (see .env.example).


## ML Models:

Install additional dependencies:pip install torch transformers


Download spaCy model: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm.


## Environment Variables:

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in API keys (e.g., Indeed, Firebase).



## Deployment

Frontend: Deploy to Vercel (free tier, auto-scales).
Backend: Deploy to Render or Railway (free tiers, no sleep for Render).
Database: Use Supabase free tier.
Monitoring: Add Sentry for error tracking (free plan).

## Next Steps

Implement job fetching via APIs (Indeed, RemoteOK, etc.).
Train salary prediction model using scikit-learn.
Integrate AI for cover letter generation (e.g., xAI Grok API, see x.ai/api).
Add CV parsing with spaCy.
Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
